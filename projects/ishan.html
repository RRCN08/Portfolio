          <h3>OVERVIEW</h3>
          <p>The project aimed to redesign a soundscape interface with the Assamese language as a use-case and create an effective visual interface design. </p>
          <p>A research project under the HSS Dept of IIT-G studied the effects of socio-linguistic factors on vowel pattern variation across different dialects of Assamese spoken in the Brahmaputra valley. </p>
          <p>I was tasked to create a well designed interface which showcases the data collected from this research for anyone in the world to access and interpret it.</p>

          <h3>PRELIMINARY RESEARCH</h3>
          <p>We went through multiple research papers detailing data representation and how we can make soundscapes to help achieve it.</p>
          <p>The following were my findings -</p>
          <ul>
              <li>Data is inherently difficult for the human brain to	understand and retain. Most adults can only store between 5 and 9 items in their short-term memory.</li>
              <li>By turning complex numbers and other pieces of information into visuals, data becomes easier to follow and use.</li>
              <li>Soundscape is a sonic landscape. It is the total acoustic values related to a certain place.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>I also looked at multiple examples of soundscapes such as the Soundsslike Project and the Pop vs Soda page to get a sense of how I can build an interface with sounds as an essential feature.</p>
        </div>

        </div>

        <div class="col-lg-10 mt-4">
          <p>Information can easily be interpreted when we create an abstraction with the sounds from the soundscape. While the user listens to the sounds, he can read and interpret the data served to him via the soundscape interface.</p>
          <p>This became our goal.</p>

        <div class="col-lg-8 mt-3">
        <p>From the research paper, the following data was representable on an interface -</p>

      <p>The existing designs for soundscapes were varied.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-lg-6 mt-5">
      <p>Soundsslike Project used small dots as identifiers for sounds. On click, it plays the audio along with details about the place.</p>
      <p>These were the flaws in their design -</p>
      <ul>
          <li>The identifiers were too tiny to click.</li>
          <li>The icons were placed too close together and mis-clicks were common.</li>
          <li>There were wasted space around the interface which took<br> most of the screen.</li>
      </ul>

        </div>


      <div class="col-lg-6 mt-5">
      <p>The Soundscape World had a different approach. It consists of a player with multiple buttons and a lot more control on the audio. These were categorised into the nature of the sound.</p>
      <p>This design was completely different from Soundsslike and it had the following faults -</p>
      <ul>
          <li>There were no information regarding the sounds.</li>
          <li> It doesn't properly guide the user to its functions.</li>

      <h4 class="mt-3"><u>2. Analyze</u></h4>
      <p>These flaws are what makes these interfaces harder to use and navigate. For each of the listed issues, I thought of various ways to tackle them. After a day’s brainstorming, I came to the following conclusion for my design.</p>
      <ul>
          <li>It has to be easily navigable.</li>
          <li>It should speak for itself.</li>
          <li>It should utilize its space.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="col-lg-9 mt-5">
      <h4 class="mt-3"><u>3. Ideate</u></h4>
      <p>After scourging the project report for hours, we finally concluded that the following data should be represented -</p>
      <ul>
          <li>Varieties map</li>
          <li>Level of pride data</li>
          <li>Audio recordings</li>
          <li>Graduated distribution of 12 terms</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Multiple iterations pen sketches and iterations were done throughout the brainstorming period. It was early on established that the interface would encompass a tabbed model for different functions for the page.</p>
      <p>Early concepts included dot-like interface similar to the Soundsslike design. It was removed in further iterations as attempts to prevent mis-clicks were futile. The Pop vs. Soda page was used as a reference to make a map which would show details while hovered over. Other iterations included Audio buttons which would take to the location in the map, but this was not preferred as the visual representation was weak.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="col-lg-9 mt-5">
      <h4 class="mt-3"><u>4. Prototype</u></h4>
      <p>The tabbed design was followed to easily differentiate the functions. We used different colours for different screens to indicate the data it’s providing.</p>
      <p>The design consists of 3 screens - Dialects, Listen, and Words.</p>

        <p class="mt-3">In the <b>Listen</b> tab, the user can listen to speech recording from various districts of Assam. Districts on-click show a pop-up where multiple play buttons are placed meticulously.</p>

        <a class="venobox" href="src/images/Ishan/Dialects.png"><img width="100%" src="src/images/Ishan/Dialects.png" alt="image alt"/></a>
        <p class="mt-3">The <b>Dialects</b> tab shows the different dialects across the state. One can hover over a region to see what variety they speak, their popularity and how proud they are of their language.</p>

      <div class="col-lg-4 mt-5">
        <a class="venobox" href="src/images/Ishan/Words.png"><img width="100%" src="src/images/Ishan/Words.png" alt="image alt"/></a>
        <p class="mt-3">The <b>Words</b> tab shows the distribution of lexical terms. 12 terms were selected which had multiple synonyms to study the usage of these words in different regions. These terms are put in a table and the distribution is shown using a gradient. Lighter shades resembled less popularity and darker for more popularity of the terms.</p>

              <h3>LIMITATIONS & FUTURE SCOPE</h3>
              <p>Our designs were limited by a couple of things, which we have mentioned below.</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Call to Action functions for the user are limited and thus interactions with the user are very minimal.</li>
                <li>Currently, there are no ways to upload audio by the user. This means our project data cannot be crowd-sourced.</li>
                <li>The recordings are short and repetitive, and hence doesn’t capture the user’s attention for long.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>If given the time and energy, a function to record the user’s speech can be implemented. This would enhance user intractability and would also serve to crowd-sourced data. Moreover, this speech can be used to compare with other audio to determine their variety.</p>
              <p>We are also currently in the process of filing a patent for the design.</p>
