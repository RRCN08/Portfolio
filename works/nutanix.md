### The challenge

Nutanix provides a leading next-generation enterprise cloud platform that converges traditional silos of server, virtualisation and storage into one integrated solution that connects to public cloud services.

During my two months over there, I worked on their flagship product, Prism, an end-to-end management solution for IT administrators to centrally manage their entire hardware stack, including storage, compute and virtual machines (VMs), all from a single tab.

##### TLDR, to create a dashboard and redesign a section to give IT administrators more visibility into their entire IT ecosystem beyond just infrastructure.

### My learnings

- This was my first time working with an enterprise company, and the opportunity to spearhead my project from start to finish was refreshing.

- I got to also co-create with other designers, and the developers from the team had a design-friendly approach. Coupled with handling the industry deadlines and working with people from different time zones, the internship proved to be an invaluable learning experience.

- Every day, technology becomes a more integral part of our lives, and we have reached that point where you can monitor your blood oxygen levels from your wristwatches. This whole space is underused, and thereâ€™s much growth potential.
