### The challenge
Roff was one of the projects that I worked on as a User Experience Intern at Interaction One Solutions Pvt. Ltd.

Roff focuses on delivering a comprehensive range of tile and stone Fixing and Care products. They also offer a wide array of products in Building Repair, Grouting Solutions, and Waterproofing and Sanitary Solutions.

##### TLDR, to redesign their current website to reflect the needs and connect with their target audience, which is also responsive and works on a wide variety of devices.

### Secondary research

###### Understanding the brief
The first week of the internship went into understanding the space which I will be working on. Interaction One provides a Creative Brief to the customers, and it has all of the important questions which would help us as a designer.

###### Target audience

###### What we will be conveying
Pidilite acquired Roff in 2004. Since then, they have been catering to a wide variety of people.
One overarching question everyone always has is why they should use Roff over regular cement while tile fixing?
Even if they were to pick an adhesive over cement, why should they choose Roff over other competitors out there?

I intended to answer all of these questions through my designs.

###### The competition
According to Pidilite and the Roff team, their competition included Saint-Gobain Weber and MYK Laticrete.
Websites of other companies such as Mapei and Kerakoll were also taken a look at.

###### Weber Saint-Gobain

- The website looks clean and aesthetic.
- Usage of keywords to identify the products is an excellent way to highlight its features and sell them to the user.
- Inclusion of disadvantages tells the user that they care about all the aspects of the product and helps them make an informed decision.
- Weber's UI tries to connect emotionally with the user by using people in most pictures.


###### MYK Latricate

- The Information Architecture of the website makes it very easy for users to navigate it.
- The catalogue of products is divided into sections and cater to specific problems, which helps with the cognitive load for the user.
- Every product is approached via a particular issue and solution. Hence the user has a clear idea of the product and its usage.
- The UI follows their brand guidelines, with proper use of colours.

###### Usability testing

Before I went deep into the userbase, I went through the current website to find out its existing problems by conducting a usability evaluation. This gave me more clarity on what I should focus on in my designs.

### Primary research

###### User base analysis

Understanding the users and whom Roff is catering to is one of the critical aspects of every design. I sat down with the Pidilite team for an hour's session, where I extensively asked about their customers and what they value the most.

###### User flow

Once I figured out the user base, and what I was focussing on, I did a user flow with the existing pages as Pidilite did not want any additional pages or tools.

### Setting the premise

###### User personae

Deriving from the target audience, I created two personae. Let's take a look at them.

###### Design Language

As I converged on to my final design, I had to set a design language to be followed throughout the entire website.

### Final designs

Over 40 wireframes were made and reiterated based on the feedback from the client.

The accent colour was based on the primary colour of the Roff logo, referred to as Roff Green. Red was used to highlight the most important keyword in a section.

This colour scheme was chosen to showcase the brand identity throughout the website.


###### Homepage
Navigation Bar concise and clear. The 'Find a Dealer' CTA is in bold to draw attention.

The primary target audience is the home-owners, so we categorised Roff's products to be approached through typical problems.

The header video grabs the user's attention, which is also the primary message to be conveyed.

The preview for the Tile Grout Matcher gives the user a sneak peek of the colour selector. It showcases the variety of grout solutions Roff has to provide.

Blogs and Current Trends show the latest trends in tiles, categorised by Living Spaces. Designed such that influencers can offer the latest trends to consumers with ease. The blog showcases posts from curators at Roff.

Testimonials show the completed projects using Roff products, along with what the customer says.

The footer contains the sitemap of the website along with Social Links for quick access.

###### Discover Solutions
The five essential solutions for consumers are tabbed for the ease of switching between the problems.

All product recommendations are up-front, so the user doesn't have to scroll down to find them.

The application video informs the user on how to apply the given product.

###### Explore Products
This page is intended for professionals who knows what they are looking for.

The Filter By option of products is based on the user journey provided to us. It quickly helps the user break down the product selection to what they need.

An adequate description is provided to better understand the product before viewing the page.

###### Product Page
The features and application areas of the product are shown upfront. The tabs describe the use-cases, benefits, and tech specifications of the product.

The Coverage Calculator provides an idea of how much quantity a user should buy.

###### Mobile screens
Pidilite wanted a responsive design, so I also took it up to create the mobile designs.

The whole design is created so that no critical information was truncated for the user, keeping the original message intact.

The screen is interactive; you may scroll to see the rest of the page.

No information has been truncated on this screen.

The Filter has been made into a button; try clicking on it.

The product page has a slightly different layout, but the content is intact.

### Reflections
Roff was the first project I did for a client, and it taught me a multitude of things, including how to collaborate with a team, deal with clients, and gave me a small insight into how the corporate world works.

The internship was during the first wave of COVID, and working from home was a different experience altogether, but the team at IO made it seamless.
