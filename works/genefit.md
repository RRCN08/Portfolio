### The challenge

The convergence of understanding of our genes and the power of technology is an area we are witnessing exponential leaps. People can now access, understand and benefit from the endlessly exciting and diverse things about our genetics.

This opens up the opportunity to improve people's health by proactively warning them of possible health risks based on their genetic insights. Combined with the advances in wearables, we can now get real-time health data from our smartwatches.
